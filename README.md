# React Carousel Component: 

A text carousel based on React class components and adaptive in nature, with number of slides being decided upon the screen size. 

Large screens will show upto 5 slides at a time initially. As the screen size reduces, so does the number of slides. The mobile screen will show 1 slide.

## How to run the project
1. Download or clone the project folder. 
2. Navigate to the path, having the package.json in the location. 
3. Open the cmd or powershell and do a `npm install` to install the dependencies. 
4. Once the packages are installed completely, `npm start` to start the project. 
5. This will compile the project and start a webserver at 3000.
6. The component will open automatically in browser at port `localhost:3000`. 


## Things to do: 
1. Make it more configurable- shapes, colors, background-image and text. 
2. Implement server calls - data structure. 
3. Write Test cases - 
6. Define Proptypes
